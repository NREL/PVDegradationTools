# Welcome to the PVDEG Tutorials

Here is a collection of Jupyter Journals ready to read, or run in your browser
through Google Collab.
Clicking on the rocket-icon on the top allows you to launch the journals on
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for interactive mode.
As per the instructions on each journal, you should uncomment the first line
that reads `pip install ...`  to install the environment if you follow this mode.

You can also clone the repository and run them locally, following the
instructions on the [PVDegTools Github page](https://github.com/NREL/PVDegradationTools)
