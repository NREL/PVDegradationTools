# PV Degradation Tools (pvdeg)

This repository contains functions for calculating degradation of photovoltaic modules. For example, functions to calculate front and rear relative Humidity, as well as Acceleration Factors. A degradation calculation function is also being developed, considering humidity and spectral irradiances models.



Documentation
=============

[Tutorials](https://github.com/NREL/PVDegradationTools/tree/main/docs/tutorials) on the usage of functions are located in the "docs > Tutorials" folder.

We also have documentation in [ReadTheDocs](https://PVDegradationTools.readthedocs.io) where you can find more details on the API functions.


Installation
============

Relative Humidity and Acceleration Factors for Solar Modules releases may be installed using the ``pip`` and ``conda`` tools. Compatible with Python 3.5 and above.

Install with:

    pip install pvdeg

For developer installation, download the repository, navigate to the folder location and install as:

    pip install -e .
