    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the calculation of a minimum standoff distance necessary for roof-mounted PV modules to ensure that the $T_{98}$ operational temperature remains under 70°C, in which case the more rigorous thermal stability testing requirements of IEC TS 63126 would not needed to be considered. We use data from [Fuentes, 1987] to model the approximate exponential decay in temperature, $T(X)$, with increasing standoff distance, $X$, as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X = -X_0 \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{T_0-T}{\\Delta T}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_0$ is the temperature for $X=0$ (insulated back) and $\\Delta T$ is the temperature difference between an insulated back ($X=0$) and open rack mounting configuration ($X=\\infty)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure showcases this calulation for the entire United States. We used pvlib and data from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) to calculate the module temperatures for different mounting configuration and applied our model to obtain the standoff distance for roof-mounted PV systems.\n"

    "\n",
    "- [NSRDB](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/) - National Solar Radiation Database. You can access data through the website for many locations accross the world, or you can use their [web API](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/) to download data programmatically. An \"API\" is an [\"application programming interface\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), and a \"web API\" is a programming interface that allows you to write code to interact with web services like the NSRDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [EPW](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/energyplus-0) - Energy Plus Weather data is available for many locations accross the world. It's in its own format file ('EPW') so you can't open it easily in a spreadsheet program like Excel, but you can use [`pvlib.iotools.read_epw()`](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/pvlib.iotools.read_epw.html) to get it into a dataframe and use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PVGIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/) - Free global weather data provided by the European Union and derived from many govermental agencies including the NSRDB. PVGIS also provides a web API. You can get PVGIS TMY data using [`pvlib.iotools.get_pvgis_tmy()`](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/pvlib.iotools.get_pvgis_tmy.html).\n",

    "### Where else can you get historical irradiance data?\n",

    "### NREL API Key\n",
    "At the [NREL Developer Network](https://developer.nrel.gov/), there are [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to a lot of valuable [solar resources](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/) like [weather data from the NSRDB](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/), [operational data from PVDAQ](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/pvdaq-v3/), or indicative calculations using [PVWatts](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/pvwatts/). In order to use these resources from NREL, you need to [register for a free API key](https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/). You can test out the APIs using the `DEMO_KEY` but it has limited bandwidth compared to the [usage limit for registered users](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/rate-limits/). NREL has some [API usage instructions](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/api-key/), but pvlib has a few builtin functions, like [`pvlib.iotools.get_psm3()`](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/generated/pvlib.iotools.get_psm3.html), that wrap the NREL API, and call them for you to make it much easier to use. Skip ahead to the next section to learn more. But before you do...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please pause now to visit https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/ and get an API key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Programming Interface (API)\n",
    "What exactly is an API? Nowadays, the phrase is used interchangeably with a \"web API\" but in general an API is just a recipe for how to interface with a application programmatically, _IE_: in code. An API could be as simple as a function signature or its published documentation, _EG_: the API for the `solarposition` function is you give it an ISO8601 formatted date with a timezone, the latitude, longitude, and elevation as numbers, and it returns the zenith and azimuth as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A web API is the same, except the application is a web service, that you access at its URL using web methods. We won't go into too much more detail here, but the most common web method is `GET` which is pretty self explanatory. Look over the [NREL web usage instructions](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/api-key/) for some examples, but interacting with a web API can be as easy as entering a URL into a browser. Try the URL below to _get_ the PVWatts energy output for a fixed tilt site in [Broomfield, CO](https://goo.gl/maps/awkEcNGzSur9Has18).\n",
    "\n",
    "https://developer.nrel.gov/api/pvwatts/v6.json?api_key=DEMO_KEY&lat=40&lon=-105&system_capacity=4&azimuth=180&tilt=40&array_type=1&module_type=1&losses=10\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to just using your browser, you can also access web APIs programmatically. The most popular Python package to interact with web APIs is [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). There's also free open source command-line tools like [cURL](https://curl.se/) and [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), and a popular nagware/freemium GUI application called [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).\n",
