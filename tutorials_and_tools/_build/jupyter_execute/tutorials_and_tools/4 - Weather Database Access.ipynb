    "- Internet access\n",
    "- NSRDB API key. API keys are free. You can request and obtain an API key in about 5 minutes. To get your own key, visit https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/\n",

    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using direct access to large scale weather databases, we're going to estimate the minimum standoff distance for a roof mounted PV system. We'll do this in 3 ways using both the NSRDB and PVGIS database.\n",
    "1. Single Location, NSRDB via NREL's high performance computer, Eagle.\n",
    "2. Single Location via NSRDB public API key.\n",
    "3. Single Location via the PVGIS public database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This journal will demonstrate all existing built-in methods for directly accessing public weather databases. Some methods are restriced to certain user groups. For general users, see methods **2** and **3**. For users with an active Eagle HPC account, you may use method **1** as well as **2** and **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all users and all steps: This journal will run significantly longer than other tutorials and have significant internet traffic as you fetch large datasets."

We use data from [Fuentes, 1987] to model the approximate exponential decay in temperature, $T(X)$, with increasing standoff distance, $X$, as,\n",
