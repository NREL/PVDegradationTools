# 'job' specifies the desired function and HPC user. This is used to determine file locaitons
#       to find a scheduler.json and for storing results
#       These two variables MUST ALWAYS BE PRESENT

function: ideal_installation_distance
user: mbrown2

# 'iterables' sets the criteria over which the simulation is iterated.
#             Currently, only spatial iteration is allowed (temporal is automatic)

# 'params_dict' contains all the necessary parameters to perform the function call
#               for some functions, this is not necessary.
#               example: ideal_installation_distance has no parameters except weather
#               Otherwise, all parameters without a default value MUST be provided here.
