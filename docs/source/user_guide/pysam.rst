PySAM Implementation
====================

PVDeg provides a convient wrapper for ``NREL-PySAM`` which is a Python wrapper for `NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) <https://sam.nrel.gov/>`_. PySAM has a steep learning curve so we seek to provide a simple implementation that allows users to run geospatial analyses with SAM.

This work was produced to support `Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE) <https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE>`_.
