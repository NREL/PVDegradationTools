    "\n",
    "Using direct access to large scale weather databases, we're going to estimate the minimum standoff distance for a roof mounted PV system. We'll do this in 3 ways using both the NSRDB and PVGIS database.\n",

    "2. Single Location via NSRDB public API key.\n",
    "3. Single Location via the PVGIS public database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This journal will demonstrate all existing built-in methods for directly accessing public weather databases. Some methods are restriced to certain user groups. For general users, see methods **2** and **3**. For users with an active Eagle HPC account, you may use method **1** as well as **2** and **3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all users and all steps: This journal will run significantly longer than other tutorials and have significant internet traffic as you fetch large datasets."

We use data from [Fuentes, 1987] to model the approximate exponential decay in temperature, $T(X)$, with increasing standoff distance, $X$, as,\n",
