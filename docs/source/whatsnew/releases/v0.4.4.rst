v0.4.4 (2024-11-19)
===================

Enhancements
--------------
- Documenation overhaul. Significant ``User Guide`` improvements. Added geospatial information with visual aids, added meteorological data page and materials access page.
- Suite of utility functions to facilitate accessing material parameter json files.  
- New Logo!  
- Created utilities for parallelized downloads of ``PVGIS`` and ``NSRDB`` so users can download geospatial data for at home simulations. This will interface nicely with the soon to be released ``GeoGridStore``, allowing users to grow stores of geospatial data overtime as their needs grow for at-home, large-scale analyses.
