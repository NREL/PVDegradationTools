    "\n",
    "A K dimensional tree is a datastructure for organizing n points in a k dimensional space. They are often used for nearest neighbors searches and many ML algorithms. Letting k = 2, our dimensions will be latitude and longitude. This is much faster than iterating over tabular data structures to find neighbors. The function to create a kdtree below requires scikit learn (also known as sklearn), a python machine learning library which is not included in the pvdeg dependency list so you will have to install it independently. Scipy also has a kdtree class but it is much slower. Depending on the number of datapoints the tree build time could be quite long but for our purposes, the cell below will be quick."
