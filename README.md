# PV Degradation Tools

This repository contains functions for calculating degradation of photovoltaic modules. For example, functions to calculate front and rear relative Humidity, as well as Acceleration Factors. A degradation calculation function is also being developed, considering humidity and spectral irradiances models.



Documentation
=============

Upcoming. Look at the tutorials folder for examples. 


Installation
============

Relative Humidity and Acceleration Factors for Solar Modules releases may be installed using the ``pip`` and ``conda`` tools. Compatible with Python 3.5 and above.

Install with:
