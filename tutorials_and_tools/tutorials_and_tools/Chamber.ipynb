    "## Defining A Chamber Test Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to load a csv containing chamber setpoints. This will define the chamber's temperature, relative humidity, irradiance, etc. for every timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema for creating a setpoints CSV file \n",
    "\n",
    "Our csv will contain a header row to define each column with a name (cannot contain spaces).  \n",
    "The `Chamber` class was designed to be easily extensible so you can add your own setpoint columns for arbitrary setpoints but there are a few rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "`step_length`, `step_divisions`, `RAMPS`\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV must contain the above columns (both in units of minutes). These determine how long a step will last and how many datapoints we will have within the step. We also need to define a RAMP for each setpoint column we include. This requires us to add a second column for each setpoint which is named `<setpoint>_ramp` where `<setpoint>` is swapped for the name of your setpoint (without the angle brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to include a column for temperature setpoints, this means we need to add a ramp rate in terms of [setpoint_units / min].  \n",
    "    If we add a column for `wind_speed` setpoints, we will need to add a corresponding column called `wind_speed_ramp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want columns for `temperature` and `irradiance_340` (irradiance at 340 nm). We will need to add `temperature_ramp` and `irradiance_340_ramp`.  \n",
    "    Our final column list will look like the following:  \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ['temperature', 'irradiance_340', 'temperature_ramp', 'irradiance_340_ramp']\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the constructor we will define the setpoint column names we want to take from the CSV. Say our CSV includes the following column names: `temperature`, `relative_humidity`, `voltage`, `irradiance_340`, `irradiance_300-400`, `irradiance_full`. But we only want to include `temperature`, `relative_humidity`, `irradiance_340`, then we specify this in the `setpoint_names` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, `skiprows` tells pandas what row indices to skip when reading the CSV. We have units in row 2, which lies at index 1 (Python is zero indexed). So we will skip the row with the units. This works because we put the index inside of a list. If we just pass it the integer then we will skip 1 row, i.e. the row with the column names.\n",
