    "## Define Geospatial Scenario Object\n",
    "Scenario is a general class that can be used to replace the legacy functional pvdeg analysis approach with an object orented one. ``Scenario`` can preform single location or geospatial analysis. The scenario constructor takes many arguments but the only required one for the following use cases is ``geospatial``. Choose ``geospatial = True`` to preform geospatial analysis or ``geospatial = False`` to preform a single location scenario. The ``name`` attribute is visible in when we display the entire scenario and is present in the file of saved information about the scenario."

For geospatial analysis, weather and metadata is collected and stored in the scenario at the time of the ``.addLocation`` method call so we do not need to include it below, but if we have other function kwargs to include, they should go in the ``func_params`` argument.  \n",
