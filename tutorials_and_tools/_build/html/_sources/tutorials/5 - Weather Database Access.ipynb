    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This journal will demonstrate all existing built-in methods for directly accessing public weather databases. Some methods are restriced to certain user groups. For general users, see methods **2** and **3**. For users with an active Eagle HPC account, you may use method **1** as well as **2** and **3**.\n",

We use data from [Fuentes, 1987] to model the approximate exponential decay in temperature, $T(X)$, with increasing standoff distance, $X$, as,\n",
